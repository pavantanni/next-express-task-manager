# 📌 Task Manager ✅

This is a simple **full-stack Task Manager app** built with **Next.js (frontend)**, **Express.js (backend)**, and **SQLite (database)**.  

The project was created as part of my internship assignment to show how I can work with **modern web technologies** and build a complete application from scratch.
